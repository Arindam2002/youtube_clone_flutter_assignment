# youtube_clone_flutter_assignment

The complete codebase for this project is on the `master` branch in this repository.

A few points to keep in mind before testing the app:

- Action buttons such as 'like', 'dislike', 'comment', etc. are not active as the required APIs were not provided.
- For video playback, `video_player` package has been used.
- For state management, `Provider` package has been used.
